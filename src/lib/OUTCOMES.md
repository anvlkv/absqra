__absQra__ is an input-output framework and delivery platform, aimed at building, delivering and measuring better user experiences in a more streamlined and flexible way.

## Overview

### current scenario

Modern apps are built with concern for the codebase, choice of frameworks and programming languages, storage and delivery solutions. All these concerns make it difficult to overcome unforeseen technical challenges and instrument the end user's experience. Moreover as app development continues choices might change, creating integrations that are difficult to maintain and implement. Which in turn puts extra weight on developers and inability of designers to argue due to tremendous amount of time required for the desired change. Certain apps when gaining popularity will require considerable amount of work to get localized and delivered to other mediums. Cross-medium experiences requiring cross-disciplinary teams and solutions that are getting out of sync in a blink of an eye. It seems that only huge companies, running development sweatshops can afford to build and maintain such experiences. Collaborative tools, especially when they are "becoming collaborative", turning out brittle and even more complicated.

### what if

What if we say that app can be naturally built using patches of code in multiple languages and frameworks, and then delivered across different media? What if we say that any software solution can be represented as sequence of input/output actions? What if we say that revisions of code create different epochs in produced data? What if the data belongs to the public? What if the code belongs to the public?

### new scenario

Apps are essentially user flows, described as sequences of inputs and outputs with flow control. Parts of the sequences are annotated for use with different medias (and localization). In any part of the sequence data context might be adjusted to implement restrictions and collaborations in a variety of configurations. Sequences can be nested and referred to. Sequences are then published, sequences can be changed, creating new epochs in its data. Data collected by a sequence is anonymized and made publicly available.

## Outcomes

### for the ones building solutions (__developers / designers__)

- design and development workflow focused on user flow, so that developers and designers can better realize what kind of experience they are going to deliver, so that solution is built around user experiences and not technical details of it
- annotations allowing to be specific where necessary or share code across mediums, so that code provides an overview of cross-medium experiences and localizations, so that it is easier to built those
- cascading contexts, so that collaborative and restrictive experiences are easier to build and manage, so that solutions built with absQra are easier to build for multi-user collaborations with security in mind
- references to external sequences, so that work done well by other sequence designers can be reused, so that better design patterns are used more often and collaboratively improved by sequence designers, so that better patterns are becoming even better
- references to subsequences, so that building a sequence utilizes a common patter - imports, so that it is easier to do code separation and maintain more complex projects
- use of epochs, so that data created by a run of sequence remains in untouched, so that there're less compatibility issues
- contextual adaptation of previous epochs, so that data from previous epochs can be used in new ones, without actual changes, so that security issues can be covered
- use of any code blocks, so that developers can create or use functions using tools and languages more suitable for a particular task, so that developers are not blocked by limitations of _ra_ language

### for the ones using the solution (__users / programs__)

- universal delivery, so that users or other code can use a solution built with absQra using their preferred medium
- solution design more focused on user flows, so that users get better experiences
- reuse of patterns, so that users will encounter certain design patterns more often, so that they are more exposed to it, so that it's easier for them to understand how to use a solution
- transparency, publicity, anonymization, so that solutions are transparent about what data they keep, and what becomes available in public access, so that users are informed and safe

### for the ones studying the data (__researchers / analysts / designers__)

- access to anonymized data from a public sequence, so that they can study well sampled data
- access to anonymized metadata from a public sequence, so that behavioral patterns can be studied as well, so that their design solutions can be further optimized
- configurable contributions for references, so that well designed sequences when used by others will collect data in accordance with their configuration, so that sequences can have a better outreach while cleared from undesired entries, so that samples are bigger and cleaner
